# Simple TO DO List

Hi there!

This is my practice in creating a TO DO LIST with Vanilla JS.

## Project Description
This project is a simple TO DO list application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add new tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as complete
- Remove tasks from the list

The goal of this project is to practice fundamental front-end development skills, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage for data persistence. This application serves as a minimalistic, responsive solution for managing daily tasks, providing a clean and intuitive user experience based on a provided design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Add a Task:** Type your task into the input field at the top of the page.
Press the "Add" button or hit "Enter" to add the task to the list.
- **Mark a Task as Complete:** Click on the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed.
Completed tasks will be visually indicated (e.g., struck through or highlighted).
- **Delete a Task:** Click the "Delete" (trash bin) icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
- **Task Persistence:** Your tasks are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they will remain even if you close or refresh the page.
- **Edit Existing Task:** Active task can be edited.
- **Responsive Design:** The TO DO list is fully responsive and can be used on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Search Bar:** You can filter tasks by any search keys.
- **Filter By Tags:** You can filter tasks by tags.
- **Filter Search Keys And Tags:** You can mix search with tags.
